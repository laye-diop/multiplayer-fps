# Task.todo

## 1. Server Development
- [x] **Initialize the Rust project for the server**
  - [x] Create a new Rust project for the server.
  - [x] Add necessary dependencies (`tokio` for asynchronous handling).
- [ ] **Set up the basic UDP server**
  - [ ] Write a basic UDP server that listens on a port and echoes received messages.
- [ ] **Manage client connections**
  - [ ] Implement handling for multiple client connections.
  - [ ] Add the ability to identify and manage clients by their IP address and username.
- [ ] **Game state synchronization**
  - [ ] Develop the logic to synchronize the game state between the server and clients.
  - [ ] Ensure regular updates of the game state to all connected clients.

## 2. Client Development
- [x] **Initialize the Rust project for the client**
  - [x] Create a new Rust project for the client.
  - [x] Add necessary dependencies (`bevy` for graphics, `tokio` for network communication).
- [ ] **Server connection**
  - [ ] Implement the logic to connect to the server using the provided IP address and username via console input.
  - [ ] Use `tokio` for asynchronous UDP communication.

## 3. Game Features Development
- [ ] **Create mazes and levels**
  - [ ] Develop the logic to generate mazes with increasing difficulty.
  - [ ] Create at least 3 levels with different maze configurations.
- [ ] **Navigation and collisions**
  - [ ] Implement the logic for navigating the maze.
  - [ ] Handle collisions with walls and other players.
- [ ] **Mini-map display**
  - [ ] Display the mini-map with the player's position and the complete maze using Bevy.
- [ ] **Frame rate display**
  - [ ] Display the current frame rate of the game on the screen using Bevy.

## 4. Optimization and Performance
- [ ] **Optimize code for performance**
  - [ ] Ensure the game maintains a frame rate above 50 fps.
- [ ] **Performance testing**
  - [ ] Test the game on different machines and configurations.
  - [ ] Identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

## 5. Testing and Debugging
- [ ] **Unit and integration tests**
  - [ ] Write tests to verify game logic and client-server communication.
- [ ] **Debug identified bugs**
  - [ ] Use debugging tools to identify and fix bugs.

## 6. Documentation and Finalization
- [ ] **Code documentation**
  - [ ] Document the main parts of the code to facilitate maintenance.
- [ ] **Installation and usage guide**
  - [ ] Write a guide to install and use the game.
- [ ] **Preparation for final demonstration**
  - [ ] Prepare a demonstration of the game to showcase all implemented features.
